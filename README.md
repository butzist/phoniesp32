# phoniesp32 üé∂üîã

A **kid-friendly jukebox** powered by the **ESP32**, inspired by
[Phoniebox](https://phoniebox.de). Unlike the original Raspberry Pi‚Äìbased
version, **phoniesp32** is designed to be **battery-operated, low-power, and
ultra-portable**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Work in Progress ‚Äî Contributions, ideas, and wiring tips are very welcome!

## üì• Download Latest Firmware

[Download Firmware](https://github.com/butzist/phoniesp32/actions) (download the
`firmware` artifact from the latest run on main)

## ‚ú® Features

- **ESP32-based jukebox**: replaces the Raspberry Pi with an ESP-WROOM-32, or
  newer.
- **Low-power & battery-ready**: runs on a Li-ion cell with TP4056 charging and
  MT3608 boost converter.
- **Bare-metal Rust firmware**: built on the [`embassy`](https://embassy.dev/)
  async embedded framework.
- **Rust-powered Web UI**: implemented with [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/)
  and served directly from the ESP32.
- **Audio transcoding & upload**: convert music files via the web frontend to
  IMA ADPCM, upload to device, and play back instantly.
- **RFID support**: scan S50 fobs with the FRC522 module to trigger playlists.
- **Affordable**: target build cost **under 15 CHF**.
